    # TODO: Check what happens when we force remove unattached storage domain (probably should add a default empty GUID as a data center
    # Answer: When we force remove an unattached storage domain, ansible tries to move it to maintenance and detach it first,
    # although it might be that this storage domain is already detached and has no related data center, therefor the move to maintenance will fail

    # We set an initial value for sp_uuid since this task is being called
    # multiple times from the main task and sp_uuid is stateful.
